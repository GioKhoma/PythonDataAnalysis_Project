# Python Data Analysis Project  

## Overview  
This project demonstrates data analysis techniques using Python to analyze employee satisfaction and salary data. The goal is to explore, clean, and visualize data to uncover key insights.  

## Features  

### Employee Satisfaction Analysis:  
- Load and process satisfaction data.  
- Calculate key statistics such as averages and trends.  
- Visualize data with histograms and boxplots to identify patterns and outliers.  

### Salary Analysis:  
- Identify outliers in salary data using statistical techniques.  
- Save detected outliers to a new file for further review.  
- Use visualizations to understand salary distributions.  

### Data Cleaning:  
- Detect and handle missing values using reliable methods like medians.  

### Quality Assurance Analysis:  
- Test claims about defect rates in data and validate results.  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib
